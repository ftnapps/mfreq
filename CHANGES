                           Changes for mfreq-suite

                       (c) 2012-2013 by Markus Reschke

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* 2012-02 / Version 3.07

all:
  - Changed setup of configuration path and temp path to support global
    defaults. Enable and change CFG_PATH and TMP_PATH in the Makefile to
    override internal defaults!
  - Streamlined logging for configuration errors.

mfreq-index & mfreq-list:
  - Added a new command to include additional configuration files (Include
    Config).
  - Added a shared FileArea command (SharedFileArea) to allow usage of a
    single fileecho configuration file by both tools.


* 2013-02 / Version 3.06

mfreq-index:
  - Automatic filepaths were created for AutoMagics by mistake, causing "file
    not available" messages by the request processor. Changed program logic to
    generate correct filepath.
  - Corrected mixed up destination and origin AKAs in the INTL kludge of the
    response netmail.


* 2013-01 / Version 3.05

mfreq-index:
  - Added support for a binary file search feature in the request processor
    by modifying the fileindex lookup file to store the filenumbers (= line#)
    of the first and the last filename for a specific first character. Also
    extended the fileindex function to write an offset file to store the
    offset of each filename in the data file. See SetMode command for more
    information.
  - Fixed bug for recursive directory processing. After leaving a 
    subdirectory an error was reported by mistake. Also added some more
    logging in case of a problem.

mfreq-srif:
  - Added a binary file search feature for faster request processing. Modified
    the read function for lookup files to support changes of the file format.
    See new SetMode switch "BinarySearch"!
  - Added detailed logging of file requests (SetMode switch "LogRequest").
  - Added "IfListed" switch to frequest limits. 


* 2013-01 / Version 3.04

mfreq-index:
  - Fixed parser bug for FileArea command. Depth and PW were parsed but
    not used.
  - Added SetMode command to set operation modes.
  - Added automatic path aliasing to reduce the size of the index data file.
    Aliases are written into an index alias file. This feature can be enabled
    by the configuration (SetMode switch "PathAliases").
  - Added automatic filepaths for the fileindex. For normal files the filepath
    will be just the path with a trailing forward slash. This reduces the size
    of the index data file.
  - Added a file check to the Magic and MagicPath commands, to test if the
    referred filepath is a regular file.
  - Added Reset command to reset several things.

mfreq-list:
  - Added Reset command to reset several things.

mfreq-srif:
  - Fixed possible variable issue in the processing of multiple file
    indexes.
  - If a reqested file is found in the index but not accessible on disk
    mfreq-srif reports "currently not available" now.
  - Added support for automatic path aliasing and filepaths (see mfreq-index).


* 2012-08 / Version 3.03

mfreq-list:
  - Added truncation of long filenames when writing filelists.


* 2012-06 / Version 3.02

all:
  - Cleaned up logging.
  - Fixed log error in command line parsing (null pointer).
  - Fixed problem writing strings with '%' to files.
  - Improved log feedback of quotation/quoting errors in Tokenize().
  - Changed timestamp in file logging for better readability 
    (new format: year-month-day hh:mm:ss).


* 2012-05 / Version 3.01

mfreq-list:
  - Added multiline support for filelists.

mfreq-srif:
  - Improved SRIF parser to support statements lacking data.
  - SRIF parser took only first part of sysops name if the full name
    wasn't enclosed in quotation marks. Fixed!

all:
  - Replaced strcasecmp() orgies with keyword tables.
  - Added sanity checks for main().
  - Command line option "-h" caused error message. Fixed!


* 2012-04 / Version 3.00
