------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* 2017-07 / Version 3.17

mfreq-srif:
  - Bug fix: no file was found with AnyCase enabled for requests with a lower
    case first character.


* 2017-07 / Version 3.16

all:
  - Added two shell scripts for creating file requests and sending files.

mfreq-index
  - Minor improvements.
  - Added "AnyCase" switch to SetMode command to create file index
    specifically sorted for case-insensitive search.

mfreq-srif
  - Several minor improvements.
  - Fixed memory management error in UnTokenize() (reported by Ingo
    Jürgensmann 2:2452/413).
  - The fix in BinaryPreSearch() introduced a new bug (reported by Ingo
    Jürgensmann 2:2452/413). Removed former fix and modified algorithm to
    converge more stable.
  - Fixed bug in case-insensitive search (reported by Ingo Jürgensmann
    2:2452/413).
  - Added limits for bad passwords (option "BadPWs" for Limit setting) and
    frequests (option "Freqs").


* 2017-05 / Version 3.15

all:
  - Modified Makefile to support DESTDIR.
  - RPM spec file (provided by Eric Renfro 1:135/371).

mfreq-srif:
  - Allow missing sysop name in SRIF. If NetMail is enabled it's changed
    automatically into TextMail.
  - Fixed issue with error reporting in ProcessRequest().
  - Fixed error in BinaryPreSearch() which caused an endless loop in a
    specific situation.


* 2015-10 / Version 3.14

mfreq-list:
  - Bug fix: when scanning an empty file area mfreq-list stopped processing
    (reported by Eric Renfro 1:135/371).

all:
  - Compatibility check for 64 bit systems.


* 2014-10 / Version 3.13

mfreq-list:
  - Added support for case-insensitive filenames in files.bbs (InfoMode
    AnyCase switch).


* 2014-06 / Version 3.12

all:
  - updated sample config files

mfreq-srif:
  - Added the IfMounted condition to the Index setting to support removable
    media, like USB disks or network drives.
  - Changed the request limit setting to support "-1" for a unlimited number
    of files or bytes.  


* 2013-12 / Version 3.11

mfreq-srif:
  - Got own product ID allocated by FTSC and updated WritePacketHeader() to
    reflect new ID.
  - Added detection of duplicate files to prevent sending the same file
    multiple times.
  - Fixed password checking bug in SearchIndex().
  - Changed logging of password errors. If "LogRequest" is enabled password
    errors are reported by the request logging.
  - The request report for the requestor treats password errors as "no files
    found" now. By omitting any information about password problems the 
    requestor is discouraged from password guessing.


* 2013-11 / Version 3.10

all:
  - Extended Bytes2String() and String2Bytes() to support IEC unit prefixes.

mfreq-list:
  - Added a "Short" format for filesizes in description files. 
  - Added InfoMode switches "SI-Units" and "IEC-Units" to enable the use of
    SI unit prefixes for in/output and IEC prefixes for output.
  - Added InfoMode switch "Relax" to ignore syntax errors in file description
    files.

mfreq-srif:
  - Added SetMode switches "SI-Units" and "IEC-Units" to enable the use of
    SI unit prefixes for in/output and IEC prefixes for output.


* 2013-10 / Version 3.09

mfreq-srif:
  - Added support for FSC-0048 Type-2+ packets (SetMode NetMail+).
  - Simplified Month2String();
  - Fixed linenumber bug in error reporting for the configuration file. 


* 2013-03 / Version 3.08

mfreq-index:
  - Added smart magic feature to select files matching specific condititions
    as a magic. Namepattern and latest filedate are currently supported.


* 2013-02 / Version 3.07

all:
  - Changed setup of configuration path and temp path to support global
    defaults. Enable and change CFG_PATH and TMP_PATH in the Makefile to
    override internal defaults!
  - Streamlined logging for configuration errors.

mfreq-index & mfreq-list:
  - Added a new command to include additional configuration files (Include
    Config).
  - Added a shared FileArea command (SharedFileArea) to allow usage of a
    single fileecho configuration file by both tools.


* 2013-02 / Version 3.06

mfreq-index:
  - Automatic filepaths were created for AutoMagics by mistake, causing "file
    not available" messages by the request processor. Changed program logic to
    generate correct filepath.
  - Corrected mixed up destination and origin AKAs in the INTL kludge of the
    response netmail.


* 2013-01 / Version 3.05

mfreq-index:
  - Added support for a binary file search feature in the request processor
    by modifying the fileindex lookup file to store the filenumbers (= line#)
    of the first and the last filename for a specific first character. Also
    extended the fileindex function to write an offset file to store the
    offset of each filename in the data file. See SetMode command for more
    information.
  - Fixed bug for recursive directory processing. After leaving a 
    subdirectory an error was reported by mistake. Also added some more
    logging in case of a problem.

mfreq-srif:
  - Added a binary file search feature for faster request processing. Modified
    the read function for lookup files to support changes of the file format.
    See new SetMode switch "BinarySearch"!
  - Added detailed logging of file requests (SetMode switch "LogRequest").
  - Added "IfListed" switch to frequest limits. 


* 2013-01 / Version 3.04

mfreq-index:
  - Fixed parser bug for FileArea command. Depth and PW were parsed but
    not used.
  - Added SetMode command to set operation modes.
  - Added automatic path aliasing to reduce the size of the index data file.
    Aliases are written into an index alias file. This feature can be enabled
    by the configuration (SetMode switch "PathAliases").
  - Added automatic filepaths for the fileindex. For normal files the filepath
    will be just the path with a trailing forward slash. This reduces the size
    of the index data file.
  - Added a file check to the Magic and MagicPath commands, to test if the
    referred filepath is a regular file.
  - Added Reset command to reset several things.

mfreq-list:
  - Added Reset command to reset several things.

mfreq-srif:
  - Fixed possible variable issue in the processing of multiple file
    indexes.
  - If a reqested file is found in the index but not accessible on disk
    mfreq-srif reports "currently not available" now.
  - Added support for automatic path aliasing and filepaths (see mfreq-index).


* 2012-08 / Version 3.03

mfreq-list:
  - Added truncation of long filenames when writing filelists.


* 2012-06 / Version 3.02

all:
  - Cleaned up logging.
  - Fixed log error in command line parsing (null pointer).
  - Fixed problem writing strings with '%' to files.
  - Improved log feedback of quotation/quoting errors in Tokenize().
  - Changed timestamp in file logging for better readability 
    (new format: year-month-day hh:mm:ss).


* 2012-05 / Version 3.01

mfreq-list:
  - Added multiline support for filelists.

mfreq-srif:
  - Improved SRIF parser to support statements lacking data.
  - SRIF parser took only first part of sysops name if the full name
    wasn't enclosed in quotation marks. Fixed!

all:
  - Replaced strcasecmp() orgies with keyword tables.
  - Added sanity checks for main().
  - Command line option "-h" caused error message. Fixed!


* 2012-04 / Version 3.00

all:
  - Beta testing done.
