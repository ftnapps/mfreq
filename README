* About

mfreq is a suite of tools for FTS style file requesting. It consists of a
file index generator, filelist generator and a SRIF compatible file request
handler. The original version of mfreq was developed for the venerable
Commodore Amiga (tm) back in the 1990ies.

Features:
  - case-sensitive and long filenames
  - filenames with spaces
  - magics
  - ifcico-style magic files
  - smart magics
  - password protected files
  - case-insensitive freqests (if enabled by cfg)
  - request limits
  - response netmail or text
  - dir.bbs and files.bbs
  - update of file description files
  - multiline support for filelists
  - tested with binkd and qico-xe


* Updating

If you update your current version of mfreq to a later one, always run
mfreq-index to update your file indexes. There might be some changes
in the file formats.


* Copyright

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                   mfreq-index

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* About

This tool scans fileechos and directories to create a file index for a fast
frequest processing later on. It also takes care of magic file names. 


* Usage

The command line usage is:

  mfreq-index [-h/-?] [-c <cfg filepath>] [-l <log filepath>]

  -h/-?  prints usage information (optional)
  -c     configuration filepath (optional)
  -l     log filepath (optional)

Whithout the -c option the default filepath "/etc/fido/mfreq/index.cfg" will
be used as configuration file. The -l option overrides the LogFile command of
the configuration file. If neither the -l option nor the LogFile command are
given, nothing will be logged.


* Hints

mfreq-index collects all file data in memory until it writes the data into
an index file. If you have to deal with memory contraints please group your
file areas and create an index file for each group. The frequest handler
will accept multiple index files.

Symbolic file links are not supported for file areas or magic files. They
will be not followed.


* Configuration

The configuration file is more like a list of commands, which are processed
by mfreq-index to create the file index. It's a simple ASCII text file. For
a quick setup you'll find an example configuration "index.cfg" in the
sample-cfg directory.


+ Basic Syntax

Empty lines and lines starting with a "#" are treated as comments. Any other
lines should contain a valid command. Commands mostly got additional arguments
and options. Arguments with spaces, like a filepath, should be enclosed in
quotation marks, for example "/fido/my files".

The command parser also supports following quoted special characters:
  - \" for a literal "
  - \\ for a literal \

Outside quotations you may also use commas instead of whitespaces to separate
options.


+ LogFile Command

Syntax:
  LogFile <log filepath>

The LogFile command specifies a filepath to be used as log file. If the -l
option of the command line is used, it will overwrite the LogFile command. This
command may be used only once. The best practice is to place LogFile as
first command in the configuration.

To prevent running several instances of mfreq-index writing the same file
index at the same time the logfile will be locked.

mfreq-index logs when it's started or ended. If you see a log entry that the
program ended with errors, please run it manually and check the standard
output for finding the cause of the error. 


+ SetMode Command

Syntax:
  SetMode [PathAliases] [BinarySearch]

With SetMode you enable following features: 

  Switch         Feature
  ----------------------------------------------
  PathAliases    create path aliases
  BinarySearch   enable binary filename search

With PathAliases enabled mfreq-index creates automatically aliases for paths
in the index data file and writes those aliases into the index alias file.
That way the size of the index data file is decreased hugely. The drawback
is that the request processing might take a little bit longer. This feature
is supported just for regular files, not magics. 

If you got a large filebase with tons of files you should enable the binary
search feature to speed up filename searching for simple requests (no wildcard
as first character). Enable this feature for the request processor too. The
speed gain is achieved by creating an additional index file and using the
well known binary search algorithm.


+ Reset Command

Syntax:
  Reset [SetMode]

The Reset command does what you would expect :-) It resets several things
back to their defaults:

  Keyword        Action
  -----------------------------------------------------
  SetMode        resets all SetMode switches 
  Excludes       clears the list of file excludes


+ Magic Command

Syntax:
  Magic <name> File <filepath> [PW <password>]

The Magic command defines a frequest magic and its corresponding file. Add a
magic command for each magic you want to serve. If you need to connect a
single magic to several files add the same magic for each file.      

A password may be specified optionally to limit access.


+ SmartMagic Command

Syntax:
  SmartMagic <name> Path <path> [Pattern <pattern>] [Latest]
    [PW <password>]

This command allows you to create magics which select specific files within a
directory based on given criteria. Following are supported:

  Keyword                Selection
  ---------------------------------------------------------------  
  Pattern <pattern>      files matching the name pattern
  Latest                 the latest file (modification time)

You may combine the conditions and set a password optionally to limit access.

A pattern supports following wildcards:
  - ? for matching a single character
  - * for matching any number of characters (including zero)

Both wildcards may be used multiple times in a single pattern.


+ MagicPath Command

Syntax:
  MagicPath <path>

The MagicPath command specifies a directory containing special magic files.
Such a magic file is a simple text file containing filepaths (one filepath
per line). The name of the magic file is used as name for the magic itself.
This method is used by ifcico for example. You may use this command multiple
times. If any file excludes are defined they'll be considered for the magic
files, not for the filepaths in the magic files.


+ Exclude Command

Syntax:
  Exclude <name or pattern>

To exclude specific files from being indexed use the Exclude command and
specify a name or a name pattern. A pattern supports following wildcards:
  - ? for matching a single character
  - * for matching any number of characters (including zero)

Both wildcards may be used multiple times in a single pattern.

Each Exclude command will add the given name or pattern to a list, which
is consulted when the MagicPath or AreaDir command is executed. 


+ FileArea Command

Syntax:
  FileArea <path> [PW <password>] [Depth <levels>] [AutoMagic]

With the FileArea command the files inside the given directory will be added
to the internal file index (stored in RAM). Use this command for each of your
file areas/echos. If any file excludes are defined they'll be considered.

A password may be specified optionally to limit access.

The Depth argument enables directory recursion with a limit of the
given levels. The level value should be in the range of 1 up to 10.  

The AutoMagic switch will create a magic for each file with the file's
extension dropped off. For example:
  - myfile.zip -> myfile  


+ SharedFileArea Command

Syntax:
  SharedFileArea Path <path> [PW <password>] [Depth <levels>] [AutoMagic]
    [switches and options from mfreq-list]

This is basically the same command like FileArea, but with a slightly
changed syntax to share the command with mfreq-list. The mfreq-list specific
switches and options are ignored. The idea is that you may put all your
fileareas into an additional configuration file and share it by the Include
command with mfreq-list.


+ Include Command

Syntax:
  Include [Config <filepath>]

If you like to spread your configuration over several files you may include
those additional files with the Include command. Nesting is limited to 2
levels (main configuration is the first level).


+ Index Command

Syntax:
  Index <filepath>

The Index command writes all files in the internal file index (stored in RAM)
to the specified filepath. Following files will be written (based on SetMode):
  - <filepath>.data
  - <filepath>.lookup
  - <filepath>.alias
  - <filepath>.offset

After writing the index the internal file index is emptied. Any new files are
collected in the file index again, until another Index command will write
those files to a new index and so on. This might come in handy if you got
memory contraints or you need different file indexes for whatever reason.


* ToDo / Feature Requests

Some stuff which needs to be fixed or would be nice to have:
  - Verbose logging (including cfg switch)?



------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                   mfreq-list

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* About

The mfreq-list tool creates filelists and cleans up description files if
requested.


* Hints

Symbolic file links are not supported for file areas . They will be not
followed.


* Description Files

Brief overview of file description files and their syntax. All files may have
lines ending with a CR (carriage return / 13).


+ simple files.bbs

Plain ASCII file containing one or more lines for each file. Lines should not
exceed a length of 78 characters.

Format:
  <name 8.3>         [<counter>] <description>
  [                              <more description>]

Values:
- name 8.3: DOS style filename (<8 chars name>.<3 chars extension>)
- counter: download counter (usually [<number>])


+ extended files.bbs

Plain ASCII file containing one or more lines for each file. Lines should not
exceed a length of 78 characters

Format:
  <name 8.3> <size> <date> [<counter>] <description>
  [                                    <more description>]

Values:
- name 8.3: DOS style filename (<8 chars name>.<3 chars extension>)
- size: in bytes without commas
- date: file date (usually MM-DD-YY)
- counter: download counter (usually [<number>])


+ dir.bbs

Plain ASCII file containing one line with the description of the directory.


+ descript.ion

Plain ASCII file containing one line for each file.

Format:
  <name> <description>

Long filenames are supported. Filenames with space(s) are enclosed in
quotations marks.


* Usage

The command line usage is:

  mfreq-list [-h/-?] [-c <cfg filepath>] [-l <log filepath>]

  -h/-?  prints usage information (optional)
  -c     configuration filepath (optional)
  -l     log filepath (optional)

Whithout the -c option the default filepath "/etc/fido/mfreq/list.cfg" will
be used as configuration file. The -l option overrides the LogFile command of
the configuration file. If neither the -l option nor the LogFile command are
given, nothing will be logged.


* Configuration

The configuration file is more like a list of commands, which are processed
by mfreq-list to create filelists. It's a simple ASCII text file. For a quick
setup you'll find an example configuration "list.cfg" in the sample-cfg
directory.


+ Basic Syntax

Empty lines and lines starting with a "#" are treated as comments. Any other
lines should contain a valid command. Commands mostly got additional arguments
and options. Arguments with spaces, like a filepath, should be enclosed in
quotation marks, for example "/fido/my files".

The command parser also supports following quoted special characters:
  - \" for a literal "
  - \\ for a literal \

Outside quotations you may also use commas instead of whitespaces to separate
options.


+ LogFile Command

Syntax:
  LogFile <log filepath>

The LogFile command specifies a filepath to be used as log file. If the -l
option of the command line is used, it will overwrite the LogFile command. This
command may be used only once. The best practice is to place LogFile as
first command in the configuration.

To prevent running several instances of mfreq-list writing the same
filelist(s) at the same time the logfile will be locked.

mfreq-list logs when it's started or ended. If you see a log entry that the
program ended with errors, please run it manually and check the standard
output for finding the cause of the error.


+ Exclude Command

Syntax:
  Exclude <name or pattern>

To exclude specific files from being listed use the Exclude command and
specify a name or a name pattern. A pattern supports following wildcards:
  - ? for matching a single character
  - * for matching any number of characters (including zero)

Both wildcards may be used multiple times in a single pattern.

Each Exclude command will add the given name or pattern to a list, which
is consulted when the FileArea command is executed.


+ Filelist Command

Syntax:
  Filelist <filepath>

The Filelist command starts a new filelist and any list output is written to
that file until a new filelist is defined or mfreq-list ends. If the given
file already exists it will be overwritten.


+ AddText Command

Syntax:
  AddText <text>

This command allows you to add some custom text to the current filelist. If
the text includes any spaces enclose it with quotation marks, for example:
  AddText "This is my custom text." 

For an empty line use:
  AddText ""


+ Define files.bbs Command

Syntax:
  Define files.bbs NameFormat <format> [NameWidth <width>]
    [SizePos <pos> SizeFormat <format>]
    [DatePos <pos> DateFormat <format>]
    [CounterPos <pos> CounterFormat <format>]
    DescPos <pos>

The command above defines the format of the files.bbs description file. It
tells mfreq-list which data fields are used. Each call will reset all settings
of the last call. The format definition is used for reading and writing.

For all arguments the <pos> value is the position of the data field, starting
with 1 for the first character (valid range: 1-120). A position of 40 means
that the data field starts at character position 40.

Arguments:

  * NameFormat <format>
  Defines file name format.

  format  description
  --------------------------------------------------
  DOS     8.3 DOS style
  Long    full name (you need to set NameWidth too!)

  * NameWidth <width>
  Defines the maximum length of the filename. If <width> is exceeded, the
  filename will be truncated with an asterisk ("*"). The valid range of
  <width> is 12 up to 60. 

  * SizePos <pos> SizeFormat <format>
  Enables file size field. Defines start position and format.

  format   description                         examples
  ---------------------------------------------------------
  Bytes-8  bytes without unit, max. 8 digits   1234
  Unit-8   bytes with unit, max. 8 chars       12kB, 12KiB
  Short-8  bytes with short unit, max. chars   12k

  The size field is right-justified! So take care when defining the position!
  Leading zeros are omitted. When reading a files.bbs file mfreq-list accepts
  any valid format, not just the one you've set.


  * DatePos <pos> DateFormat <format>
  Enables file date field. Defines start position and format.

  format    description   examples
  -----------------------------------
  US        MM-DD-YY      04-20-13
  ISO       YYYY-MM-DD    2013-04-20

  * CounterPos <pos> CounterFormat <format>
  Enables download counter field. Defines start position and format.

  format    description   examples
  ----------------------------------
  Square-2  [nn]          [12], [7]
  Square-3  [nnn]         [345]
  Square-4  [nnnn]        [6789]

  The counter field is right-justified! So take care when defining the
  position! Leading zeros are omitted.

  * DescPos <pos>
  Sets start position of file description.


+ Define filelist Command

Syntax:
  Define filelist [NamePos <line-pos>] NameFormat <format> [NameWidth <width>] 
    [SizePos <line-pos> SizeWidth <width> SizeFormat <format>]
    [DatePos <line-pos> DateFormat <format>]
    [CounterPos <line-pos> CounterFormat <format>]
    DescPos <line-pos> DescWidth <width>

This command defines the output format of the filelist. It's similar to the
"Define files.bbs" command. To support multiline output some data field
positions may have a line number included using following syntax:

  <line>-<pos> or <line>.<pos>

When omitting the line number, mfreq will assume the line number being 1. For
example:

  - 1.10 means position 10 in line 1
  - 1-10 same as above
  - 10   same as above
  - 3-40 means position 40 in line 3 

The maximum line number supported is 5. To add empty lines skip line numbers.
If you set NamePos to 2-<pos> an empty line is added before the file name.

  * [NamePos <line-pos>] NameFormat <format> [NameWidth <width>]
  Position (range: 1 - 120), width (range: 12 - 60) and format of file name:

  format  description
  ---------------------------------------------------
  DOS     8.3 DOS style
  Long    full name (you need to set NameWidth too!)  

  * SizePos <line-pos> SizeWith <width> SizeFormat <format>
  Position (range: 1 - 120), width (range: 4 - 12) and format of file size:

  format  description             examples
  --------------------------------------------
  Bytes   bytes without unit      1234
  Unit    bytes with unit         12kB, 12KiB
  Short   bytes with short unit   12k

  The size field is right-justified! So take care when defining the position!
  Leading zeros are omitted.

  * DatePos <line-pos> DateFormat <format>
  Position (range: 1 - 120) and format of file date:

  format    description   examples
  -----------------------------------
  US        MM-DD-YY      04-20-13
  ISO       YYYY-MM-DD    2013-04-20

  * CounterPos <line-pos> CounterFormat <format>
  Position (range: 1 - 120) and format of download counter:

  format    description   examples
  ----------------------------------
  Square-2  [nn]          [12], [7]
  Square-3  [nnn]         [345]
  Square-4  [nnnn]        [6789]

  The counter field is right-justified! So take care when defining the
  position! Leading zeros are omitted.

  * DescPos <line-pos> DescWidth <width>
    Position (range: 1 - 120) and width (range: 18-80) of description field.


+ InfoMode Command

Syntax:
  InfoMode [dir.bbs] [files.bbs] [Update] [Strict] [Skips] [Relax] [SI-Units]

  Switch      Feature
  -------------------------------------------------------
  dir.bbs     enable use of dir.bbs/DIR.BBS
  files.bbs   enable use of files.bbs/FILES.BBS
  Update      enable update of file description file
  Strict      enable strict position checking for data fields
  Skips       allow missing data fields behind filename
  Relax       don't end processing of file description file on
              syntax errors
  AnyCase     match file names case-insensitive
  SI-Units    enable SI byte units
  IEC-Units   enable IEC byte units output

With InfoMode you set several switches for file description files and select
sources for file descriptions. When you enable files.bbs, you have also to
define it's format with the "Define files.bbs" command. In case the dir.bbs
switch is set, mfreq-list reads the area description from that file if
available.

If you want mfreq-list to update the description file, e.g. removing deleted
files, please set the Update switch.

For strict position checking set the Strict switch, i.e. the start and end
positions of the defined data fields must match exactly. The Skips switch
allows missing data fields after the filename (premature end of line). With
Relax set mfreq-list ignores syntax/format errors in file description files
and keeps processing. So you'll get a filelist in any case. But be warned that
the Relax switch may cause a lot of warnings being logged. If you set Relax
and Update you can convert file descriptions files into the desired format. 

When you got issues with the case-sensitivity of filenames on disk and in the
file description file, you can enable AnyCase to match the filenames case-
insensitive. For example, if the filenames on disk are lower case and the
filenames in the files.bbs are upper case. Make sure that you don't got any
filename doubles when case-insensitive matching is applied. For double
filenames on disk the first one found will get the file description. Any other
double is treated as a new file not in the file description file yet. If you
got doubles in the file description file, all descriptions of all doubles will
be added to the first matching filename found on disk.
 
The SI-Units switch enables metric unit prefixes for any input and output, i.e.
1 kB = 1000 Bytes. By default the binary prefix system is used. The IEC-Units
switch enables output of the IEC prefix recommendations (1024 Bytes = 1 KiB)
and overrides the SI-Units switch for output.


+ Reset Command

Syntax:
  Reset [SetMode]

As expected this command resets several things back to their defaults:

  Keyword        Action
  -----------------------------------------------------
  InfoMode       resets all InfoMode switches 
  Excludes       clears the list of file excludes


+ Include Command

Syntax:
  Include [Config <filepath>]

If you like to spread your configuration over several files you may include
those additional files with the Include command. Nesting is limited to 2
levels (main configuration is the first level).


+ FileArea Command

Syntax:
  FileArea <name> Path <path> [Info <description>]

The FileArea command scans a directory and writes a sorted list of files to
the current filelist. Specify the file echos name and path. The Info argument
overrides any other source of the fileareas description.


+ SharedFileArea Command

Syntax:
  SharedFileArea Name <name> Path <path> [Info <description>]
    [switches and options from mfreq-index]

This is basically the same command like FileArea, but with a slightly
changed syntax to share the command with mfreq-index. The mfreq-index specific
switches and options are ignored. The idea is that you may put all your
fileareas into an additional configuration file and share it by the Include
command with mfreq-index.


* ToDo / Feature Requests

Some stuff which needs to be fixed or would be nice to have:
  - Support special formatting of additional description lines in files.bbs?
    ("<spaces>+ <desc>" / "<spaces>| <desc>")
  - Support comment lines in files.bbs?
    (" <comment>" / "--- <comment>")
  - Support of descript.ion?
  - Support file_id.diz? Try to extract?
  - Ignore a missing directory and keep processing?
  - Verbose logging (including cfg switch)?



------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                   mfreq-srif

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

* About

This is the SRIF frequest handler. It reads the mailers SRIF file, processes
the file request while checking for any limits, writes a response list and
creates a response netmail or textmail if configured. mfreq-srif requires an
file index created by mfreq-index.


* Usage

The command line usage is:

  mfreq-srif [-h/-?] [-c <cfg filepath>] [-l <log filepath>] -s <SRIF filepath>

  -h/-?  prints usage information (optional)
  -c     configuration filepath (optional)
  -l     log filepath (optional)
  -s     SRIF filepath (required)

Whithout the -c option the default filepath "/etc/fido/mfreq/srif.cfg" will
be used as configuration file. The -l option overrides the LogFile command of
the configuration file. If neither the -l option nor the LogFile command are
given, nothing will be logged.

If you are running binkd you would add following to your binkd.cfg:

  exec "/path-to/mfreq-srif -s *S" *.req

For qico-xe please add following to qico.conf:

  srifrp  /path-to/mfreq-srif -s


* Hints

Symbolic file links are not supported for file areas or magic files. They
will be not followed.

All FTS addresses (AKAs) will be normalized into following format:
  <zone>:<net>/<node>.<point>[@<domain>]

The <domain> part is optional and nodes get point number 0.


* Requests

Requests with the following format are supported:
  <filename pattern> [!<password>]

Each line should contain a single filename or pattern with an optional
password separated by a space. Due to internal token processing the
password may also be separated by comma or whitespaces. A filename or pattern
with spaces needs to be enclosed in quotation marks, e.g. "my file.lha".

Wildcards:
  - ? for matching a single character
  - * for matching any number of characters (including zero)

Both wildcards may be used multiple times in a pattern.


* NetMail/TextMail

The frequest handler creates a response netmail or textmail for the requestor
and adds the netmail packet or textmail file to the response list (with the
delete-me-after-sent indicator).

A result textblock is generated for each requested file/pattern:

  <empty line>
  <file/pattern requested>
     - <file found or other feedback>
    [- <file found or other feedback>]

The message is formatted like this:

  [MailHeader]
  <Result>
  [Result]
  ...
  [Result]
  [MailFooter]

Password errors are treated like "no files found". By omitting any
information about password problems the requestor is discouraged from
password guessing.


* Configuration

It's a simple ASCII text file. For a quick setup you'll find an example
configuration "srif.cfg" in the sample-cfg directory.


+ Basic Syntax

Empty lines and lines starting with a "#" are treated as comments. Any other
lines should contain a valid setting. Settings mostly got additional arguments
and options. Arguments with spaces, like a filepath, should be enclosed in
quotation marks, for example "/fido/my files".

The command parser also supports following quoted special characters:
  - \" for a literal "
  - \\ for a literal \

Outside quotations you may also use commas instead of whitespaces to separate
options.


+ LogFile Setting

Syntax:
  LogFile <log filepath>

The LogFile setting specifies a filepath to be used as log file. If the -l
option of the command line is used, it will overwrite the LogFile command. This
setting may be used only once. The best practice is to place LogFile as
first setting in the configuration.

mfreq-srif logs when it's started or ended. If you see a log entry that the
program ended with errors, please run it manually within a test environment
and check the standard output for finding the cause of the error. For the
test environment simply create a pair of fake SRIF and request files. 


+ SetMode Setting

Syntax:
  SetMode [NetMail] [NetMail+] [TextMail] [RemoveReq] [AnyCase]
          [BinarySearch] [LogRequest] [SI-Units] [IEC-Units]

With SetMode you enable following features: 

  Switch         Feature
  ----------------------------------------
  NetMail        send response netmail (type-2 packet, FTS-0001)
  NetMail+       send response netmail (type-2+ packet, FSC-0048)
  TextMail       send response textmail (plain ASCII file)
  RemoveReq      delete request file after processing
  AnyCase        match file names case-insensitive
  BinarySearch   enable binary filename search
  LogRequest     log file requests in more detail
  SI-Units       enable SI byte units
  IEC-Units      enable IEC byte units output  

When netmail response is enabled, but the SRIF lacks the sysop name, the
setting is automatically changed into textmail.

Please set the RemoveReq switch if your mailer doesn't delete the request file
after calling the frequest handler.

If you've enabled the binary search feature for mfreq-index, enable it here
too. This feature uses an additional index file to perform a binary search to
speed up the processing of file requests.

With LogRequest set mfreq-srif logs which files are requested and which are  
going to be sent.

The SI-Units switch enables metric unit prefixes for any input and output, i.e.
1 kB = 1000 Bytes. By default the binary prefix system is used. The IEC-Units
switch enables output of the IEC prefix recommendations (1024 Bytes = 1 KiB)
and overrides the SI-Units switch for output.


+ Address Setting

Syntax:
  Address <zone>:<net>/<node>[.<point>][@<domain>]

This defines your FTS addresses (AKAs). At least you should set your main AKA.
Add an Address setting for each AKA.


+ MailDir setting

Syntax:
  MailDir <path>

This setting is optional and specifies the path for response netmails or
textmails. A good choice would be your outbound directory or /tmp. Used only
once in the configuration. If not set, the default path "/var/tmp" will be
used.

Example:
 MailDir /tmp


+ MailHeader/MailFooter setting

Syntax:
  MailHeader <text>
  MailFooter <text>

Both settings allow you to add some custom text to the netmail or textmail
response. MailHeader adds text at the top of the mail and MailFooter at the
bottom. In between mfreq-srif will report any results of the request. The text
is written to the mail in the same order as in the configuration.

If the text includes any spaces enclose it with quotation marks, for example:
  MailHeader "This is my custom text." 

For an empty line use:
  MailHeader ""

Some message readers won't display empty lines at the beginning of a netmail.
To circumvent that just add a space, like:
  MailHeader " "
  MailHeader "bla bla"


+ Limit Setting

Syntax:
  Limit <FTS address pattern> [Files <files>] [Bytes <bytes>]
        [IfListed]

This settings limits what a requester may retrieve. Actually it's a list of
rules linked to a specfic FTS address pattern. The first matching rule will be
used.

The FTS address pattern is based on the normalized format (see hints)
  <zone>:<net>/<node>.<point>[@<domain>]
and supports following wildcards:
  - ? for matching a single character
  - * for matching any number of characters (including zero)

Both wildcards may be used multiple times in a pattern.

Some examples:

  pattern          matches
  -----------------------------------------------------------
  ?:*              any system in a zone with one digit
  2:*              any system in zone 2
  2:240/*          any system in zone 2 and net 240
  *@fidonet        any system in domain fidonet
  *                any system (for a rule of last resort)

The Files argument limits the number of files which may be requested. And
the Bytes argument defines the maximum number of bytes allowed. Both values
should be in the range of 0 to 2147483000 (2^31 - 1). Zero means "none", i.e.
that node won't get anything. There is also the special value "-1" for a
unlimited number of files or bytes.

For the byte value you may use following units:
  - kB for kilobytes (binary in default mode, decimal if SI units are enabled)
  - MB for megabytes (binary in default mode, decimal if SI units are enabled)
  - GB for gigabytes (binary in default mode, decimal if SI units are enabled)
  - KiB for kibibytes
  - MiB for mebibytes
  - GiB for gibibytes

Place the unit directly behind the value or enclose the term in quotation
marks if you insert a space:
  - 10MB
  - "10 MB" 

Some examples:

  Limit 1:2/3.4 Files 0
  -> deny any files for 1:2/3.4

  Limit 2:240/* Files 10 Bytes -1       
  -> net 2:240 get's up to 10 files with unlimited size  

  Limit * Files 10 Bytes 5MiB
  -> anyone else get's up to 10 files with a total size of 5MB

With the IfListed switch set, the rule is only used if the node is listed
in a nodelist. That information is provided by the mailer via the SRIF file.

If you define any rules, it's strongly recommended to define also a rule of
last resort, like
  Limit * Files 10 Bytes 2MB

The following defaults are used if no limit is given at all:
  - 20 files
  - 2000000 bytes


+ Index Setting

Syntax:
  Index <filepath> [IfMounted <path>]

The Index setting adds a file index to be used for file searching. You may
add several file indexes if you like.

The <filepath> argument will be expanded to match all the data files for a
single index:
  - <filepath>.data
  - <filepath>.lookup
  - <filepath>.alias
  - <filepath>.offset

For removable media you can set the IfMounted option. In that case the index
is only considered if a filesystem is mounted at the given path. Of course
you should have created a dedicated index with mfreq-index before.


* ToDo / Feature Requests

Some stuff which needs to be fixed or would be nice to have:
  - Support Time setting in SRIF file?
  - Exit if a maximum runtime is exceeded?
