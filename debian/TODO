debian/TODO for mfreq
=====================

- Instead of the minimal man pages created for the Debian/Ubuntu packaging,
  use help2man to dynamically create them the man pages from the executables?
  Or encourage upstream to create source files usable to create them, as well
  as html versions of them?  

- If/when new source archives are available at an internet accessible place,
  update debian/watch for how they are available.

- Do the 'See Also' entries in the man pages all need commas? Or not?

- Review wording etc. in all man pages, update as needed.
